        <p class="title">Programming languager</p>
        <p>Learning Java programming during my first year at university has been an intellectually stimulating and rewarding experience. Starting from the basics of variables, loops, and conditionals, I've progressively delved into more complex concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. The structured curriculum, dedicated professors, and collaborative learning environment have provided a solid foundation for my programming journey. Beyond coding itself, I've learned the importance of designing efficient and scalable solutions, writing clean and maintainable code, and collaborating with classmates on challenging projects. Java's versatility and real-world applicability have motivated me to explore various domains, from software development to data science and beyond. This first-year journey has ignited my passion for programming and laid the groundwork for my future as a computer scientist and developer.</p>
